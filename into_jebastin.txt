hi deepika
i have one question 
in chatbot u mentioned its only 


---------------------------------------------------

"Good morning! Over the past two days, I explored 
the 'Person + Webpage' feature, and I found it
 absolutely amazing—especially the chatbot, 
highlights, and how it presents pages. 
One thing I noticed is that while there's a 
'Last Visited' section under 'Recent', 
I couldn't find any indication of how much 
of the book I've completed. It would be really 
motivating if there were a progress indicator—like 
showing 90% completed or 10% remaining. That kind 
of feedback would
 definitely boost enthusiasm for learning!"
